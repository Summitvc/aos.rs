# aos.rs
A client for communicating with piqueserver protocol.
My first project written in rust.

## How to install?
### Linux: 
1. install rust
2. `sudo apt install cmake`
3. `git clone https://github.com/Summitvc/aos.rs`
4. `cargo run`

## How to create my own bot?
The bot part comes in main.rs, everything else is just a library so to create your own bot, delete/move the current main.rs file and create a new one.
You can check an example that comes by default with the repo(main.rs).
